# Underwater-Bio-acoustic-Audio-Sound-Classification-using-spectro-temporal-features
Underwater bio-acoustics provides some information on marine biodiversity, ecological
health and behaviors of mammals. Marine monitoring and conservation programs require
proper classification of such sounds. This paper develops a general pipeline for the Classification
of underwater broadband bio-acoustic signals using spectro-temporal features underprocessing
raw-technique initiated techniques begun with start and SVM and water audio
data to lessen noise and enhance the quality of signal. Spectro-temporal features including
(Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, spectral centroid, bandwidth and zero-crossing
rate) are estimated from Short-Time Fourier developed spectrograms Transform (STFT).
These features encapsulate both the frequency and temporal dynamics enabling effective
differentiation between classes of sound. SVM is sensitive in this task because it allows
high dimensional application in tolerating the same. It captures non-linear relationships
between feature spaces. Therefore, it is an invaluable adjunct to the complex and overlap
spectral-temporal patterns in underwater acoustic data. Unlike classical approaches
e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) or basic neural nets, SVMs, etc. robustness against overfitting,
especially with small or imbalanced datasets, thereby showing good performance
in real-world situations. Further, its computational efficiency both during training and
inference it only then becomes feasible in applications requiring either real-time or high
throughput processing. Extracted features were normalized and then presented to an SVM
classifier, along with the optimized RBF kernel to which grid search tuning was carried
out for the critical overperformance by the new SVM fusion. Compared to deep learningx
based methods that have computational intensity and/or can be ( for example, need much
more annotated data). Therefore, the proposed classification algorithm used here works
pretty well on publicly released under water acoustic datasets and it is proved that it differs
from other marine mammal calls and environmental sounds this new system presents a
novel combination that involves feature extraction and classification of balances accuracy
by computational efficiency so is a valuable tool for automation of identification of marine
species and monitoring underwater soundscapes with the assistance of the the strengths of
this technique have ramifications in both marine research and conservation efforts with a
scalable, efficient, and robust solution.
